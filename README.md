RainbowShift Klipper Code for WLED Effects


Very early code of bed temp and progress display on rainbowshift by Vector3d https://vector3d.co.uk/product/rainbowshift-kit/


So This assumes ALOT..
Like you have the WLED section in "moonrafer.conf" and that they are called "DaybreakNeos"
  https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#wled

You also have in your macros the WLED Macros provided by https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/


Also your using a Daybreak with 13 pixles on it, and this all works by using the WLED Web address when you set them up.

Currently Its also fixed colours Blue (cold) to Pink (Hot) / Blue (0%) to Pink (100%) complete
